This visual presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, showcasing key insights through histograms, bar charts, and a correlation matrix. It highlights patterns in survival rates based on features like passenger class, sex, age, fare, and port of embarkation. Notably, females and first-class passengers had higher chances of survival, while most passengers did not survive. The heatmap reveals correlations among variables, and the bar plots emphasize disparities in outcomes. The findings guide data-driven interpretations and provide a foundation for predictive modeling. This summary serves as a quick, comprehensive overview of trends, relationships, and data distribution.
